# Library Management System Analysis
# Goal
The objective of this presentation is to analyze the library management systemâ€™s data using SQL queries to answer key questions related to book loans, 
borrowers, and library branches.

# Tools Used
SQL for data querying, database management systems for executing the queries.

# Tech 
**Programming Language**: SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying the database.

**Database Management System (DBMS)**: Likely relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server for storing and querying the library database.

**Data Manipulation**: SQL queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, COUNT, and WHERE clauses for data retrieval and analysis.

**Database Design**: Schema focused on book availability, borrower activity, and branch-specific operations.
